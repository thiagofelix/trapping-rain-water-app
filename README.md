## Trapping Rain Water

![](preview.png)

This is a simple app that solves the [trapping rain water](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trapping-rain-water/) coding challenge.

I found this exercise quite specially because you can visualize the problem and have some intuition before actually developing it so I decided to create a react app that make it easier to 
visualize the elevation map and amount of water can be trapped.
